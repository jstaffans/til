# Mocking protocols: shrubbery

In general, I try to define the boundaries of my system as protocols. I am all with 
[James Reeves](https://www.booleanknot.com/blog/2016/01/24/how-i-use-component.html) on 
that one. 

Mocking these protocols for testing can be cumbersome. There is a nice library 
called [shrubbery](https://github.com/bguthrie/shrubbery) that can help with that.
